I am a mathematician and a data scientist currently working in Huawei Ireland Research Center. Before I was a postdoc in algebraic geometry in Universiteit van Amsterdam and École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne. Along the way, I fostered quite a bit of interest in AI and math modelling. Even earlier, I did a PhD in mathematics in University of Warsaw. 

Presenting my life journey graphically (some pictures even link to some of my work -- feel free to talk a look:), I was doing a little bit of this:

and now I do a little bit of that:

Along the way, I also had quite a bit of fun with:
